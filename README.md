Created Multiobjective de novo drug design with recurrent neural networks to generate randomized SMILES (molecules) â€¢Integrated Pathway Enrichment Analyses, Auto-Dock, and ADMET filters to test ligand binding affinity

In the December of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (2019- nCoV) appeared and subsequently proliferated across the world. Starting in China, this virus spread rapidly through East Asia and made its way west, infecting hundreds of thousands in Europe and eventually reaching North America. With a lack of effective treatment, this study was undertaken with the purpose of finding/creating and evaluating molecules that pose to be good candidates for COVID-19 drug based treatments. The primary methodology concerned: a) identifying treatments for diseases with similar biological pathways as COVID-19 using pathway enrichment analyses, b) creating a multiobjective de novo drug design with recurrent neural networks utilizing the aforementioned drugs and randomized drug databases (Moses and ChEMBL) as the training dataset, c) ranking molecules using ligand binding affinity and Tanimoto similarity after each neural network generation d) constructing final dataset using top molecules from each generation and re-evaluating the binding affinity of molecules with the coronavirus protease (from protein data bank, found through x-ray diffraction). I ran the multiobjective de novo drug design with recurrent neural networks for 12 generations, finding 48 molecules with high binding efficacies. Out of these 48, only 11 were under 1,000 daltons in weight. These final molecules had binding efficacies ranging from -17.9 to -18.3, indicating a potential effectiveness as COVID-19 treatments.
